== Security

All REST API endpoints are secured by bearer tokens in https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7519[JWT] format.
To access the endpoints each request must include an _Authorization_ header of type _Bearer_.

```
Authorization: Bearer dXNlcjpzZWNyZXQuzhgngZHnhgghhggh...
```

To get such token you have to interact with the identity provider service.
